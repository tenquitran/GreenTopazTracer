TODO:
- after flipping the image vertically in the window (to correspond to the file output), a thin white stripe appeared at the top.
- the Release version produces an image with black dot artifacts. For some configurations of the scene the same happens in the Debug version.
- if the window is closed during ray tracing, the app fails.
